<h1>FES</h1>
<h2>Full Express Server <i>(FES)</i> is a full express server setup and run script :)</h2>
<p>It allows you to fully setup an http express-based web server that can give you pages and also subdomains!
    <br>All you have to do is download <b>FESStart.js</b> and run "<code>node FESStart.js</code>" and the rest is handled for you.
</p>
<p>This is the home example, you can delete this file and replace it with your own, just make sure to look in "<code>/src/ExpressServerSettings/config.json</code>" for the config file and make any needed changes.</p>
